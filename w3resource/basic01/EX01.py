# 1. Write a Python program to print the following string in a specific format (see the output). Go to the editor
# Sample String : "Twinkle, twinkle, little star, How I wonder what you are! Up above the world so high, Like a diamond in the sky. Twinkle, twinkle, little star, How I wonder what you are" Output :

# Twinkle, twinkle, little star,
# 	How I wonder what you are! 
# 		Up above the world so high,   		
# 		Like a diamond in the sky. 
# Twinkle, twinkle, little star, 
# 	How I wonder what you are

# I would try to solve this by reading in the long string into a container and use print statements with spacing, but the could be a better way.

print("Twinkle, twinkle, little star,\n\tHow I wonder what you are!\n\t\tUp above the world so high,\n\t\tLike a diamond in the sky.\nTwinkle, twinkle, little star,\n\tHow I wonder what you are")
